# UNIX

These are working examples from the "Advanced Programming in the UNIXÂ® 2nd Edition" book by W. Richard Stevens & Stephan A. Rago. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a revision to the apue.h file, which all the example files/projects from the text depend on. I found these projects to be extremely useful and was initailly not able to run them. 

It was not easy to locate a solution to this issue, therefore I decided to post my revision. Also I provided a way of making each example project portable from the apue2e directory to be able to test, understand these projects and or add to an existing project.
