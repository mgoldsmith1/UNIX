# UNIX

These are working examples from the "Advanced Programming in the UNIXÂ® 2nd Edition" book by W. Richard Stevens & Stephan A. Rago. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a revision to the apue.h file, which all the example files/projects from the text depend on. I found these projects to be extremely useful and was initailly not able to run them. 

It was not easy to locate a solution to this issue, therefore I decided to post my revision. Also I provided a way of making each example project portable from the apue2e directory to be able to test, understand these projects and or add to an existing project. 

I do recall locating a readme for these files that explain how to set this header such that all the projects the apue directory can run without including that header, but then you would not be able to build these projects outside of the directory. Hence why I placed the updated header in each of the project folders.

I found these projects to be very useful for adding features to a small OS for my OS course, which I will be posting soon.
